# CT2003_GroupAssignment
Group Assignment for NTU module CT2003 - Internship Management System

==---------------------------------------------------==
Ethan's Update 06/11/25

Created 1 new folder StaffFiles:
Created 2 new file in StaffFiles -> staffmain.java and staffutil.java
Created a new CSV called internship.csv

usage explanation:
staffmain.java -> will be main landing page for after staff login, please import this to central and the entry point should be method called StaffEntry()

staffutil.java -> all the functions that are used in staffmain can be found in staffutil, this is so that if the future internship stuff required a similar function can just take from staffutil without touching the main tab

Have also created internship.csv to replicate the idea I have, to be confirmed during next discussion about usage
